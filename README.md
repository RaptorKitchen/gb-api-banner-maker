# Giant Bomb API Top Five Banner Maker

Create a fun image of your top five of anything in the Giant Bomb database.
 
Start by clicking an empty picture frame, then type the name of a person, place, object, or thing. If the Enter key is pressed or if the user stops typing for two seconds or more, the application will try fetching results available from the Giant Bomb API (It's a website about video games).

Try finding a background and frame combination you like. If so inclined, feel free to take a screenshot.
